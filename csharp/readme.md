The aim is to complete 50 "small" projects, of about 100 lines of code each.
The number of projects will give a good range of topics.
The size of the projects will give a good feedback look on progress.

## Approach

Use this resource at (edabit)[https://edabit.com/challenges/csharp] to get project ideas.
Start with 10 of the easiest projects, and work up to the harder ones for each decade.
