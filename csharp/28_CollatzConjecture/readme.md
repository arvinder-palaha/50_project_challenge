# Collatz Conjecture

## Description

The Collatz conjecture is a sequence of numbers generated by starting with any positive integer and repeatedly applying the following operation:

- If the number is even, divide it by 2.
- If the number is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.

The conjecture states that no matter what starting number is chosen, the sequence will always eventually reach 1.

## Goal

Write a function that takes a positive integer as input and returns the number of steps it takes to reach 1 following the Collatz sequence.

## Examples

```csharp
collatz(2) ➞ 1
collatz(3) ➞ 7
collatz(10) ➞ 6
```
