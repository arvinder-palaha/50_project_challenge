# Hamming Distance

The Hamming distance between two strings of equal length is the number of positions at which the corresponding characters are different.

## Examples

HammingDistance("abcde", "bcdef") ➞ 5

HammingDistance("abcde", "abcde") ➞ 0

HammingDistance("strong", "strung") ➞ 1

## Goals

- [ ] Take two strings as arguments.
- [ ] Return the Hamming distance between them.
- [ ] Handle bad inputs.
